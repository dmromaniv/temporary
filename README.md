# Bills-project README
## Project Description
This project is a test assignment where I utilized React and Typescript to create a form. The main technologies used include React for building the user interface and Typescript for adding static types to the project, ensuring a more robust codebase.

## Styling
I employed Material-UI (MUI) components to style the user interface. MUI provides a set of pre-designed React components and styles, enabling a clean and responsive design for the application.

## Form Validation
For form validation, I utilized Yup and Formik. Yup is a JavaScript schema builder for value parsing and validation, providing a simple and intuitive way to validate form data. Formik, on the other hand, is a form library for React that helps with the management of form state, validation, and submission. Combining Yup and Formik ensured proper form validation, enhancing the user experience.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project was to create a form and implement accurate form validation. By using React, Typescript, MUI components, Yup, and Formik, I successfully achieved this objective, demonstrating a solid understanding of these technologies and their integration for form handling and validation.
